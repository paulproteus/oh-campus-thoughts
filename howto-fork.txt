To fork a project on Github:

* Start out logged in to Github

* Visit the project you want to fork

* Click the "Fork" button in the top-right

* Wait for the animation to conclude

* Notice that your browser is now visiting a copy of the project in your personal space,
  rather than the old, group-owned one. You should also see a "fork of..." remark
  in the top-left.


Now, clone to it to your computer:

* On the right side, look for the clone URL

* Copy that to the clipboard

* Open a terminal and type: "git clone " (including the space, but not including the quotation marks)

* Use your terminal to "paste" the URL in

* Once you've done that, 


Now, make sure you have the project properly set up:

* Open index.html in your favorite text editor -- it should look like a regular HTML page

* Open index.html in your favorite web browser -- it should render just the same as
    http://purdue.openhatch.org/

* Make a test change in index.html, save, and reload in the browser. Make sure
    what you see in the the browser reflects that change.

* Undo that change, with your edtor, save, and then reload in the browser.
    Make sure what you see in the browser reflects that change.


Now, find a bug on the project's issue tracker that you will work on, and
make it be assigned to yourself.

Now, work with your text editor to resolve it!

Now, commit your changes by typing:

    git add index.html

    git commit -m "Explanation of my changes"

Now, publish those changes on Github by typing:

    git push

Now, visit Github and make sure your personal fork contains those changes.

Now, visit your personal fork and click the "Pull requests" button on the right.
This will offer you the chance to "Create...". Explain what you did, and leave
a remark that this relates to the issue number you saw.

Now, get feedback from the project's maintainer, and eagerly await your pull
request getting merged!

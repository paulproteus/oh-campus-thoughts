Change images on the website

The website has photographs of students from 2010. That's so long ago! 
Styles have changed; accessories have modernized; hair styles have 
vastly improved. Maybe humans themselves have gone out of style.

We need someone to replace the images with something else. It is up to 
you what the new images will be!

Some tips:

* Make sure that the licensing on the image gives you permission to 
add them. An easy way to make sure if that is to choose Creative 
Commons-licensed images. You can find great re-usable images on 
Wikimedia Commons, at http://flickr.com/creativecommons , or by using 
the advanced search within Google Image Search, just to name or by using 
the advspecial 

* You can find imagean fyou 
have 
permission to add the images to the 
project.

Add verbs to web site

Right now, on the website, all the verbs have been replaced by the word 
"verb" (or "verbing").

We need some verbs! Otherwise, how will people know what to expect?

It'd be great if someone can submit a pull request to fix this. Make 
sure to only replace the placeholder verbs, not the real ones.

Tip:

To search for all the instances of adjective, try typing:

    git grep -i verb

in your terminal. You need the "-i" to search case-insensitively, since 
the word "Verb" (with a capital V) does also appear.

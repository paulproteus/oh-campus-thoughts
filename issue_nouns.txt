Add nouns to web site

Right now, on the website, all the nouns have been replaced by the word 
"noun" (or "noun(s)").

We need some nouns! Otherwise, what will the website be about?

It'd be great if someone can submit a pull request to fix this. Make 
sure to only replace the placeholder nouns, not the real ones.

Tip:

To search for all the instances of noun, try typing:

    git grep noun

in your terminal.

Add adjectives to web site

Right now, on the website, all the adjectives have been replaced by the 
word "adjective".

We need some adjectives! Otherwise, how will people know what to expect?

It'd be great if someone can submit a pull request to fix this. Make 
sure to only replace the placeholder adjectives, not the real ones.

Tip:

To search for all the instances of adjective, try typing:

    git grep adjective

in your terminal.
